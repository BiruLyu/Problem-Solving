# Directed acyclic graph

DAG is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles.

# Topological Ordering

A **topological ordering** of a directed graph is an ordering of its vertices into a sequence, such that for every edge the start vertex of the edge occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of the edge.

# Problems

## Topological sorting

**Topological sorting** is the algorithmic problem of finding a topological ordering of a given DAG. It can be solved in linear time.

## is DAG

It is also possible to check whether a given directed graph is a DAG in linear time.
